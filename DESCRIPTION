Description: The 'ggplot2' package provides simple functions for visualizing contours
  of 2-d kernal density estimates. 'ggdensity' implements several additional density estimators 
  as well as more interpretable visualizations based on highest density regions instead of
  the traditional height of the estimated density surface.
